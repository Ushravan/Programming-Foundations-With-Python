#Perimeter of Rectangle
#Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.
#Note: Perimeter of Rectangle = 2(Length of Rectangle + Breadth of Rectangle)
#Input

#The first line of input contains the length of the rectangle, which is an integer.
#The second line of input contains the breadth of the rectangle, which is an integer.
#Output

#Print the Perimeter of the Rectangle
#Explanation

#For example, when the length of the rectangle is 3 and breadth is 4, then
#Perimeter = 2 x ( 3 + 4 ) = 2 x 7 = 14

A = int(input())
B = int (input())
perimeter_of_rectangle = 2*(A+B)
print(perimeter_of_rectangle)
