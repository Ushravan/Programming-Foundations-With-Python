#Basic Arithmetic
#Write a program to take two integer inputs (say A and B) and print the result of the following operations:
#1. Addition
#2. Subtraction 
#3. Multiplication

#Output

#The first line should contain the sum of the two given integers.
#The second line should contain the subtraction of the two given integers.
#The third line should contain the product of the two given integers.

#Explanation

#In the given example, the inputs are A = 4 and B = 3
#Addition: 4 + 3 = 7
#Subtraction: 4 - 3 = 1
#Multiplication: 4 * 3 =  12

A = int (input())
B = int(input())
print(A+B)
print(A-B)
print(A*B)
