# Print in Reverse Order
# Write a program that reads two lines of input and prints those two lines in the reverse order. (Print the message given in the second line of input before the first line of input)

# Explanation

#In the given example, the first line of input is "Book" and the second line of input is "Pen", so the output should be 
#Pen
#Book
A = input()
B = input()
print(B)
print(A)
