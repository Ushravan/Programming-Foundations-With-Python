#Area of a Rectangle
#Write a program to calculate the area of the Rectangle.
#Note: Area of Rectangle = Length of Rectangle x Breadth of Rectangle
#Input

#The first line of input contains the length of the rectangle, which is an integer.
#The second line of input contains the breadth of the rectangle, which is an integer.
#Output

#Print the Area of Rectangle


#Explanation

#For example, when the length is 4 and breadth is 3, then A = 3 Ã— 4, therefore A = 12

A = int(input())
B = int(input())
area_of_rectangle = A*B
print(area_of_rectangle)
